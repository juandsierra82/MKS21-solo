There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

Writers Unblock

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

It helps you generate ideas if you are stuck. Helps you come up with a timeframe, and scores the feasibility of your idea.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

Got writer's block? Don't know what your next fabulous app will be. We will help you come up with some good ideas from the start. This fabulous app will help you come up with ideas, rate the ideas, and bring in the great google resources to help you get started. It will also analyze the scope of the problem and whether or not you can fit it in your busy busy schedule with just a click of the button. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves. 

It's very hard to brainstorm; this product does it for you. Hopefully, by the end of the app, I will come up with a great idea for an actual app.

## Solution ##
> The app will ask the user to enter the purpose of the project (work, study, hobby) 
    The app will then ask the user to either 1) type the first thing that comes to mind about the topic
  or 2) choose get going, and the app will generate a set of topics for the user. 
The app will basically make a Google Wiki search on the results. It will group these results into main "topics" and display these results as questions for the user. The user will either provide another question for the search to add to this original search, or choose one of the computer topics.
If the user chooses to narrow the topic via computer, the computer will then go to the wikipedia page and use the ISBN numbers to point to a books page based on wikipedia results to provide further reading for the idea and amazon page based on users who buy "this product results".

It will provide these results via search options.

The user can choose to :

1. Search further, the computer will search the web further with the new search criteria

2. If the user does not get any ideas from the sources, the computer will remember and make a new search excluding the content of the pages and asking the user to choose again. (it should also exclude similar websites).

3. Once the user finds an idea they like, the computer will say Eureka and provide the user with all the sources associated with his or her idea to further explore it. The computer will be able to save the search and further refine on the search for the future.

## Quote from You ##
  > With this app, I got an idea for a paper in 30 seconds. Now I'm CEO of my own company.

## How to Get Started ##
> Describe how easy it is to get started. Just type in an idea, click enter--like the ideas, explore further; don't like them start again.'

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
"I was stuck in Maker'sSquare MVP challenge; I used the app, and afterwards, I got a job at Google exporting my MVP challenge to starving children with no internet'"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. 
Reader should go to Google.com directly for more information.
